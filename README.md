#  Weather Forecasting Using Spatio‑Temporal Modeling

A data-driven weather prediction tool that uses spatio‑temporal modeling and sequence learning to forecast weather variables over time.

---

##  Project Overview

This repository implements an LSTM-based spatio‑temporal forecasting pipeline to predict weather variables. The solution is designed to learn both temporal patterns and spatial dependencies across multiple sensors or geographical locations.

---

##  Repository Contents

- `train_model.py` – Train and save an LSTM forecasting model using historical weather data.  
- `predict_model.py` – Load the trained model to generate weather forecasts.  
- `fetch_weather.py` – Retrieve live or historical weather data (e.g., via an API).  
- `app.py` – Web service interface to serve real-time predictions or visualization.  
- `weather_lstm_model.h5` – Pre‑trained LSTM model weights for quick inference.  
- `README.md` – This documentation.

##  Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy, Pandas** — Data preprocessing
- **Keras / TensorFlow** — LSTM-based model implementation
- **Flask** (optional, via `app.py`) — REST API for serving predictions
- **External API integration** (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) — For weather data ingestion

##  Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow flask
```

### 2. Prepare Training Data

Ensure your weather time-series data (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) is structured and accessible via fetch_weather.py or pre-populated files.

### 3. Train the Model

```bash
python train_model.py
```
This will save the model as weather_lstm_model.h5.

### 4. Generate Predictions

```bash
python predict_model.py
```
Use the trained LSTM to forecast future weather values based on input data.

### 5. Launch the Web Interface (Optional)

```bash
python app.py
```
Access the prediction API locally:

```bash
http://localhost:5000/predict?city=YourCity
```

 Model Architecture

The core of this system is an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network, trained on historical multivariate weather data. The model captures temporal dependencies and can ingest sequential data from multiple locations to produce future forecasts.

 Evaluation

Model performance should be assessed using standard regression metrics:

    Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

    Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

Adapt evaluation in train_model.py or a dedicated script.
 Notes & Tips

    Customize input and output features in train_model.py and predict_model.py for variables like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

    If using external APIs for data retrieval, configure API keys and endpoints within fetch_weather.py.

    Flask-based interface in app.py is minimal—modify routing and response schema as needed.

 Suggested Enhancements

    Clearly document the training and prediction data formats.

    Add sample input/output files or Jupyter notebooks.

    Provide guidelines for extending to spatio-temporal grid or multi-site forecasting.
